# Blockstack "Jubilee Campus" Blockchain Learning Program

Near the end of CovHack2020, I decided I wanted to learn more about blockchain and its potential applications.
So using the MLH tutorial on Blockstack, I modified the "animal kingdom" program to aid my learning and relate
it to my home university.

This submission is submitted towards the Blockstack ("Best use of Blockstack") MLH Challenge as listed on the MLH site.
